# Overview

This project was about trying to get two phones to communcate with each other. This is proof of concept, but it's not fully executed. 

I used a client-server networking system, start the server first and then the client next. The client and server have almost identical code and both can send and receive messages asyncronously.

This is going towards a project that I am doing with friends as we are trying to make a text-encoder.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

* Client-Server (Though in the future I'll mover to Peer-Peer)

* TCP

* The messages will be user input and will be received and displayed as Server -> Client: 'Input' and Client -> Server: 'Input'

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Android Studio
* Java

### Libraries

* import java.io - used to read and write input between the programs
* import java.net - used to set up the sockets
* import java.util.Scanner - used to scan for user input
